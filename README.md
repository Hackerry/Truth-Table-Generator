# Truth-Table-Generator
This GUI generates truth table of some simple logic.
The algorithm is straightforward but somewhat redundant, considering I'm now learning this part of discrete math. I'll pose future improvements under this repository.

ShortCut:
Ctrl+N = NOT
Ctrl+A = AND
Ctrl+O = OR
Ctrl+I = IMPLY
Ctrl+B = BICONDITIONAL

Capital T means TRUE and capital F means FALSE.
