# Truth-Table-Generator
This GUI generates truth table of some simple logic.
This updated version uses StringBuilder instead of multiple lists. It's more straightforward and deals with variables that are two or more characters long. The tests I run may not be exhausted but in many simple cases, it runs correctly.

ShortCut:
Ctrl+N = NOT
Ctrl+A = AND
Ctrl+O = OR
Ctrl+I = IMPLY
Ctrl+B = BICONDITIONAL
Binary Ouput means the result will be shown with 0/1 instead of T/F

Capital T means TRUE and capital F means FALSE.
